# Virtual Art Gallery - Highlighting art at Suny Oswego

This project is a virtual explorable art gallery aimed at putting the students at Suny Oswego that are interested in the arts at the forefront of conversation by providing them with a platform that allows them to connect and recognize each other in their creative capacity.

This project exists in limited capacity and function, but illustrates understanding of hypermedia techniques and creativity.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built to meet a course requirement, but has potential to continue as an independent platform wither within the indented Suny Oswego community or elsewhere.
