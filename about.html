              <p class="lead my-3">The State University of Oswego provides a lot of opportunities for students of all backgrounds aiming to become professionals in a number of fields.
                The majority of attendees happen to be business majors because that’s what Oswego is mainly known for and the rest trickle down into STEM fields.
                What Oswego is not well known for, is its department of art and design as well as the programs they offer to students seeking an art degree.
                The college claims that their art department provides students with the tools needed to create foundations for the future,
                while emboldening them to explore the tangible and rhetorical dimensions of art. So, art is supported in official capacity at oswego.</p>
                <p class="lead my-3">
                This project is aiming at putting the Oswego students who love the arts and photography at at the forefront of conversation by providing them with a platform to effectively share their work with
                each other. The theme is ‘Art at Oswego’, we're hoping to highlight the content that lives on these shores of Lake Ontario and that the talented students that set foot on this campus can grace our
                virtual art gallery experience with the pieces that they have created.
              </p>
              <p class="lead my-3"> Please enjoy the experience.</p>
              <p class="lead mb-0"><a href="index.html" class="text-white font-weight-bold">Return to Gallery...</a></p>
